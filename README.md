# Supabase Bucket Management API

This project provides an API for managing Supabase storage buckets using Express.js. The API includes functionality to create, update, delete buckets, and manage files within those buckets.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- Supabase account and project
- `.env` file with Supabase credentials

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file:**

   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the placeholders with your Supabase project credentials.

   ```env
   SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
   SUPABASE_KEY=<your-supabase-key>
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Create an uploads directory:**

   Make sure to create the directory for temporary file uploads.

   ```bash
   mkdir uploads_temp
   ```
